# Overview
JOBR is a Job search toolkit helping job seekers keep organised throughout their search for a new role. This is a full stack project and my first experience using Python and Django as the back-end. The whole application was built and delivered over 8 days in a group of three devs.

## You will find the deployed app here: https://jobrrr.herokuapp.com/

# The Brief
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **React Hooks** is optional for this project
